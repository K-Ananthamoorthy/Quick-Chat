## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites:
- **Node.js** (v14+)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Git**

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/K-Ananthamoorthy/Quick-Chat
   cd realtime-chat-app
   ```

2. **Install Server Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the `server` directory and install the necessary dependencies.
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Client Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the `client` directory and install the necessary dependencies.
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Backend Server:**
   Run the Express server.
   ```bash
   cd ../server
   node index.js
   ```
   The server will run on `http://localhost:4000`.

5. **Start the Frontend (React):**
   In another terminal, navigate to the `client` directory and start the React app using Vite.
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the Application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`. You should now see the real-time chat interface.

## Running the Application

- **Server**: The backend runs on `http://localhost:4000` using Express and Socket.io.
- **Client**: The frontend is served using Vite and runs on `http://localhost:5173`.

### Communication via Socket.io
- The client and server communicate over WebSockets, using the Socket.io library.
- Messages are broadcast to all clients connected to the server.

### Key Commands:
- To **send a message**, type in the input field and click the **Send** button or press **Enter**.
- Messages will appear instantly for all connected users.

## Future Enhancements

- **Authentication**: Implement user login/signup for a more personalized experience.
- **Chat Rooms**: Support multiple chat rooms where users can join and create rooms.
- **Message History**: Store chat history in a database such as MongoDB.
- **Typing Indicator**: Show when other users are typing a message.
- **File Sharing**: Allow users to send images or files.
